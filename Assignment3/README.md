Add several methods to the FizzBuzz class.
Move the “printing” logic to a method that takes two parameters that define the range of numbers,0
inclusive, that should be printed (e.g. calling the method print(4,252)
will print the numbers from 4 to 252 inserting factor words as above).
Add two additional methods that allow me to add,remove or inspect existing factors.

The “add” method should take a map as a parameter.
The “remove” method” should take any number of factors as parameters.
The “inspect” method should print a list of all factors, in sorted order, as follows:

    Factors:
    1.  2 => alpha
    2.  3 => beta
    3.  5 => gamma

Use gstrings to generate output.
